Rock-Paper-Scissors game project.

In this project I'm going to demonstrate my knowledge of some basic JavaScript topics:

- variables, arithmetic operations;
- comparison operators, conditional statements, logical operators;
- functions;
- problem solving. 

I'm going to update this project later. For now I only have the algorithm to play 5 rounds of RPS.
